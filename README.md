# **Spam_Email_Classification**
Spam email, also known as junk email, refers to unsolicited messages sent in bulk, typically for advertising, phishing, spreading malware, or other fraudulent purposes. Using UCI dataset I have buit a machine learning model to distinguish the spam and non-spam mails. There are 58 attributes and 4601 instances in dataset. The name of my dataset is spambese which is present in the form of text. Using python I have conveted it into tabular form with the help of pandas library.
# **Methodology**
The project involves the following steps:

<u>1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:</u>
'-'  Load the dataset and assign appropriate feature names.
'-'  Separate features and labels.
'-'  Split the data into training and testing sets.
'-'  Standardize the features for better model performance.

<u>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</u>
'-'  Examine the dataset structure and class distribution.
'-'  Visualize feature correlations to identify patterns.

<u>3. Feature Selection:</u>
'-'  Although all features are initially used, feature selection can be performed to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

<u>4. Model Training and Evaluation:</u>
'-'  Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
'-'  Consider using other models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for comparison.

<u>5. Hyperparameter Tuning:</u>
'-'  Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the Logistic Regression model.
'-'  Evaluate the best model on the test set and compare its performance with the initial model.

<u>6. Model Testing:</u>
'-'  Validate the model on unseen data to ensure its generalizability.

**Conclusion**
The spam email classification project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying spam emails. By leveraging the SPAM E-mail Database, the project showcases the steps involved in preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling data for accurate email classification. The final model can be integrated into email systems to filter out spam and enhance email security.
